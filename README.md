Deployed Site:  https://mitchevans.github.io/golfScoreCard

A golf scorecard created with Javascript, HTML, CSS and Materialize. 

Log your score as you play a round of golf. This app will create your boxscore and track your score over or under par. Local storage is utilized to persist data throughout your round. 

Click on the "Add Score" button after each hole you play. The default score is 3 (the app is currently set for an all par 3 course) but you can change your score by clicking on the 3 and inputing another score. Future versions will allow the user to change par for each hole to match whichever course the user is playing.

Click on the back arrow button if you need to correct the score on the previous hole you logged. Log as many holes as you can play.
