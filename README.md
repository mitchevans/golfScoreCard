Deployed Site:  https://mitchevans.github.io/golfScoreCard

A golf scorecard created with Javascript, HTML, CSS and Materialize. Log your score as you play a round of golf. The app will create your boxscore and keep track of your score over or under par. Click on the "Add Score" button after each hole you play. Defaule score is 3 (the app is currently set for an all par 3 course) but you can change your score by clicking on the 3 and inputing another score. Future versions will allow the user to change par for each hole to match wichever course you are playing. Log as many holes as you like.
