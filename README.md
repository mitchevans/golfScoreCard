Deployed Site:  https://mitchevans.github.io/golfScoreCard

A golf scorecard created with Javascript, HTML, CSS and Materialize. 

Log your score as you play a round of golf. This app will create your boxscore and track your score over or under par. 

Click the "ADD" button to log your score after each hole. The default score is par (the app is currently set for an all par 3 course). You can change the score you would like to log by clicking on the left or right arrows on either side of the "3" in the center of the screen. Future versions will allow the user to change the value of par for each hole to match whichever course the user is playing.

Made a mistake entering a score? Click the back arrow button at the bottom of the page if you need to delete the previous hole you logged. Local storage is utilized to persist data throughout your round. The "CLEAR" button will remove your data from local storage and clear the boxscore. Log as many holes as you would like.
